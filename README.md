# Freckles the Lizard

An in-progress ESP32 microcontroller project.

A robot in the shape of a lizard that develops a preference for color using humidity data and colors it detects with Adafruit's Flora Color Sensor. 

When given colors to choose from, it will make choices based on its accumulated preferences. 

## Current Progress

- Established Wi-Fi connection 

- Implemented code to fetch weather API data

## Future Updates

- Use RGB sensor to detect colors on objects 

- Implement machine learning/NN and set initial weights with humidity data

- Install LEDs (the lizard's freckles) and program them to change to the lizard's preferred color

- Construct a lizard form out of 3D printed parts
