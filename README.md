# Freckles the Lizard

An in-progress ESP32 microcontroller project.

A robot in the shape of a lizard that develops a preference for color using humidity data and colors it detects with Adafruit's Flora Color Sensor. 

When given colors to choose from, it will make choices based on its accumulated preferences. 

## Future Updates

- Interpret humidity to color data

- Display preferred color on LEDs (the lizard's freckles) 

- Establish communication between the lizards

- Construct a lizard form out of 3D printed parts
